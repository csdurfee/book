    "# Don't Be a Sucker\n",
    "by Casey Durfee <csdurfee@gmail.com>\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "This started because I got tired of people talking about their gambling losses online. Why talk about how you lost money doing something that you should have known would lose you money? Every season there are more ads and more talk about gambling, and it's definitely making sports worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contributes to this environment where the meta -- the stats, the highlights, the talking points -- are more important than the competition itself, and that's sad. Athletes shouldn't be treated like malfunctioning random number generators. If sports aren't interesting on their own, then why bother? Someone could take the jersey numbers of their favorite athletes and buy a lotto ticket with those numbers and it's almost the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I was curious about how it worked.  I'm trying to convey a little common sense and intuition about how this stuff actually works, as a math problem and a cultural phenomenon. There are a whole lot of thought experiments, dubious philosophical insights, and silly jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried to avoid too much formal mathy stuff, instead running little simulations to illustrate ideas. I hope it's fairly approachable, but not too much. Gambling is all math after a couple of bets. So maybe I can help some people transfer their irrational math anxiety into rational betting anxiety. Math can be your pal. The casinos can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Disclaimer\n",
    "Gambling can be addictive. Anyone can become an addict. Addiction is not a question of intelligence or virtue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you're saying, \"I don't know I'm going to lose\". True, but you're also not going to bet one time, especially if you win. Success is the worst teacher. What happens over the long term? Betting is about statistics, not feelings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to try betting without the losses? Just do it on paper. What's the downside? People play board games with fake money and trade stocks with fake money and still have fun. OK, a lot of family Monopoly games end in tears, but nobody's broke in real life at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see, the bets that sportsbooks push on naive gamblers are guaranteed losers in the long run, regardless of skill. Even if you know more about sports than the average bettor, you're still going to lose money taking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I think it is possible to make money on it, maximizing profits does require knowing how much of an edge you have over the sportsbook. So even someone who wants to be successful should probably start on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would guess maybe 1% of bettors make money long term. The estimate I see online is 3%, but that seems way too high, given the massive influx of new bettors and the rise of crappier types of bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's definitely not a 50/50 split between winners and losers. I wonder if that naive assumption drives some people to bet. For a lot of things in life, being slightly above average is good enough. This isn't one of those things."

    "\n",
    "Do with that what you will. Maybe get that as a back tattoo. Everybody else isn't doing that!\n",
    "\n",
    "If 97% of sports bettors are losing money on it, going with the conventional wisdom will definitely lead to failure. Is that fun? Wouldn't winning be more fun? Why play a game that will just make you feel bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Games of skill and chance\n",
    "Sports gambling was legalized on the premise that it's a game of skill. People were told it's not like \"real gambling\" where the winner is randomly decided. Of course, the lottery isn't a game of skill and that's legal almost everywhere, but that's not run for-profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's supposedly about who knows more about sports. And that's plausible. Sports-knowing is a sort of skill. Making predictions about the future that are better than random is a skill, too. Maybe there's some sort of American civic virtue in the combination of the two.\n",

    "\n",
    "I remember back in early 2017, getting in a disagreement with somebody online over whether Andre Drummond or Nikola Jokic would be the better NBA player in the long run. He didn't want to make a bet on it, unfortunately. I think Drummond was an All-Star that year and Jokic was still a nobody. He would often get winded after about 5 minutes and commit a silly foul so he could get subbed out. I should've gotten pretty good odds on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between games of skill and games of chance is significant to me. Many things have an element of chance to them. Certainly sports. Despite the randomness, most of the time, the team that plays better wins the game. It's possible to win the game through merit. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's not true of some types of sports bets. Skilled bettors will lose less often, but they will still lose over the long run."

    "\"You wanna bet on it\" is also the key to an idea in the area where philosophy and economics meet called [Decision Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory).  Both economists and philosophers have a keen professional interest in what is or isn't rational behavior. It makes things way messier if you have to account for people who behave in ways that don't follow logical patterns. Economists need perfectly rational human beings even more than they need [spherical cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow). I've seen some awfully fat cows, but I've never seen a perfectly logical human.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you determine whether an individual made the right choice for themselves? Sometimes, it's a subjective judgement based on what the individual values. But, the theory goes, if betting according to a person's stated beliefs would be guaranteed to lose them money, their beliefs are irrational. Not because you or I think they're irrational, but because they violate the rules of probability theory and logic, and lead to these guaranteed losing bets. Look, I'm not saying you're crazy, [Abraham De Moivre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Moivre) is!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the Dutch Book Theorem. \"Making a book\" means a situation where a bookmaker is guaranteed to win money no matter the outcome, and a Dutch Book is specifically when they'll make the exact same amount either way. They're getting paid the same amount regardless of who wins.\n",

    "\n",
    "I accept you can't really say it has a negative expected value for the individual. If a gambler's goal is to lose money in an entertaining fashion rather than make money, then maybe they aren't irrational for betting the way every other loser does. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a dark side to this. People aren't paying thousands of dollars to buy picks because they want to lose money in a more fun way. They do it because they think it will make them money in the long run. Or at least make them back the money they have already lost.\n",

You can do that knowing you'll probably lose money, and it might bring some extra fun if it's a game you'd enjoy anyway. I only know that gamblers who bet regularly are supposedly doing it to make money. If somebody's habitually taking sucker bets despite expecting they will make money, I think that's a clear Dutch Book situation. It also makes gambling a potentially more addictive habit than drugs. I don't think anyone starts using drugs because they think it will make them rich.\n",

    "\n",
    "These bets may as well be rigged carnival games. If you take the wrong types of bets, your skill or knowledge doesn't matter. They are losers for everybody who can't see the future.

For example, betting the under point total for the 1st half parlayed with the under for the whole game. If the 1st half goes under, it's a lot more likely that the whole game goes under.\n",

For instance team X might win more often when Player Y scores over 30 points. So the payout on an SGP is lower than the parlays we've looked at so far.\n",

    "Theoretically, there could be value on SGPs. If they price a parlay at +1200 but it wins 10% of the time, that's a nice return. But the payout for every single one is a huge math calculation that the sportsbook does for the bettor. The player would need to do those same calculations to know whether they're getting a fair price (positive expected value on the bet). But why would a sportsbook give the player a fair price? \n",

If a line is too high, a bettor can take the underdog and make a bet with positive expected value. Likewise if it is too low, they can take the favorite. The sportsbook's easiest way of making money is to attract an equal amount of bets on both sides, so they make money no matter who wins. You're not betting against them, they're just facilitating the bet. If the spreads are way off, people can exploit that.\n",

There is no way for the market to correct or punish bad prices, so there's no reason to believe they are ever fair, unless the sportsbook made a mistake. And why wouldn't they ban any bettor taking advantage of those mistakes? They could just track how often players are using the SGP pricing tool and block anyone who is using it too much, or simply winning too much on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple sportsbooks offer SGPs, so there may be some competition on price, but there's no incentive to make the price fair. If FanKings is offering the SGP at +600 and DraftDuel is offering it at +550, a naive bettor might take the +600 and think they're smart for bargain hunting. But if the SGP will only win 5% of the time, they're both horrible choices.\n",
