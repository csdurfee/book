    "\"People aren't coins\", you might say. Which is true. A coin doesn't have any memory. People have good days and bad days. It's entirely believable that a tout might be in an especially good mood, or especially \"locked in\" to what is happening on every team, or the games are easier to predict in a particular period of the season, so their win rate is higher than usual. Could we tell that just by looking at their recent results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the tout has good skill weeks and bad skill weeks, or some other period of time. Some periods, their picks are no better than a coin flip, other periods their picks are excellent at 57.4%."

    "Maybe there are small details that a random walk enthusiast could notice, but the entire 1,000 game random walks just look like other random walks. There are long trends that last for hundreds of games and multiple switches between probabilities. These longer trends aren't caused by anything, they just emerge when you take a bunch of random data and turn it into a random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no reason to act as though hot streaks exist if natural variation explains the data just as well. We still get \"hot streak\" like behavior even though half the time we're essentially making the pick with a coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the paradox of mediocrity comes in again. A true *cold streak* would be getting 50% wins for a long period of time, not losing 8 out of 10, or some smaller pattern. But there's no way to conclude you're at 50% winning instead of 57% winning in just a few games. Someone who got zero hits in baseball after 100 at-bats is probably bad at hitting. There's a way to tell if somebody can't do it at all. But with betting, someone who can't do it at all is still going to be right 50% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this scenario is an oversimplification. If someone is switching between \"good at betting\" and \"bad at betting\" it's not happening exactly every 100 games, right? If we made the switches at random times instead of a regular schedule, or the switches were more frequent, it should be even harder to tell.\n",
    "\n",

    "A tout who has gone 8-2 in their last 10, but wins 54% of the time overall is probably going to keep winning 54% of the time. The 8-2 record doesn't necessarily tell us anything about the tout's next pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player's edge over the house on sports betting may not stay constant. Some parts of the season may be easier to bet than others. So even though a tout has a constant level of skill, they could win at higher rates in some parts of the season. I think that's something that could only be noticed after the fact, by comparing several years' worth of results, though."

    "If it were a machine learning system making the picks, it would be easy to calculate a confidence level for the prediction. Those types of models output a number between 0 and 1, where 0 might be take the underdog, and 1 is take the favorite. They're never exactly 0 or 1, so to make predictions, we round the number. If the output is .45, that rounds down to \"take the underdog\", but it's less certain than if the output is .0001.\n",

    "So, if variable bet sizing is used, it only does better than taking the same size on every bet 75% of the time. Although I didn't intend to do it that way, that roughly the same breakdown as the touts on pyckio who use variable bet sizing -- 75% were improved by it, 25% wree hurt by it.\n",

    "The relative weighting for A, B, and F in terms of number of units, doesn't matter as long as they're in the right order (A > B > F). It does, however, have a huge impact on the change in profitability. at a 1-2-3 scale, the weighted betting earns on average 8.2 more units. At a 1-3-5 scale (which roughly matches the percent rate of return for each class of bet), it's 16 more units."
