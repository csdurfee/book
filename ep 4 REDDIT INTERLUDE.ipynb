The best NBA teams lose 25% of their games, and the worst NBA teams win 25% of their games, so even a good team losing to a bad team isn't all that surprising over the course of an 82 game season."

    "If a good majority of the players don't give a single fuck (to use the parlance of our times), why would the underdogs be competitive? Wouldn't their players also not give a single fuck? Why would they be the underdogs if all it took to win was fuck-giving? I'd love to see the advanced stats on that -- this guy's got the most fucks per 36 since Wilt Chamberlain!\n",
    "\n",
    "Underdogs are \"so competitive\" because that's how the line works. The underdog is supposed to win 50% against the line. That's true regardless of how hard both teams are playing.\n",

    "I watch a lot of basketball and it's incredibly rare to see players on the court not trying, but it's incredibly common to see fans saying players \"don't care\" whenever the other team plays well on offense, or their team plays poorly on offense. I think it's a new basketball fan thing -- it takes a while to understand how to watch defense. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it's so much worse than it was before sports betting became legal. Bettors don't seem to watch the game to enjoy it, or learn from it, or even just have something on in the background.

How could you ever learn anything about basketball in such a condition?\n",

    "Shouldn't someone want to on the side of the smart money? It's a game of skill, why wouldn't you emulate people with skills? If you wanted to get good at basketball, you should probably emulate people who are good at it, not commiserate with a bunch of other people who don't know how to do it after you lose a game."

The 76ers bench only played a combined 41 minutes in that game. All five starters played an average of 40 minutes. In essence, the 76ers ran a six man rotation.

    "\"Tanking\" is when the management of a basketball team decides to deliberately be bad in order to get better draft picks later on.

Father Time is undefeated.\n",

    "But I would assume players and coaches don't tank, ever. It's an upper management decision, not a labor decision. They have absolutely no reason to deliberately suck at their jobs.  Maybe they perform worse because being on a tanking team is a bummer, but there's no reason for them to be bad on purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a marginal player on a team that's bad, and as an organization is trying to tank. Why wouldn't the player try hard? The worse the team is, the more likely they draft someone better than him and he loses his job. Every game is a potential to make a name for themselves and find the next job in basketball. Playing on a bad team is already a strike against them. Maybe they were part of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "I definitely don't think Portland is trying to tank. They have more young players than they have playing time, and several guys who are finally coming into their own this season. They could be pretty good next year with a couple veterans to show them the ropes. And the year after that, who knows? \n",

Anyone who takes the other side must be the stupidest person on the face of the earth. Thus when they lose, rather than learn from the experience, they have to convince themselves that the league is somehow corrupt, because people who don't follow basketball closely can't predict who is going to win beforehand. \n",
