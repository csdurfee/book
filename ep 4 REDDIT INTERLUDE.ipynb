The best NBA teams lose 25% of their games, and the worst NBA teams win 25% of their games, so even a good team losing to a bad team isn't all that surprising over the course of an 82 game season."

    "I watch a lot of basketball and it's incredibly rare to see players on the court not trying, but it's incredibly common to see fans saying players \"don't care\" whenever the other team plays well on offense, or their team plays poorly on offense. I think it's a new basketball fan thing -- it takes a while to understand how to watch defense. But it's so much worse than it was before sports betting became legal. Bettors don't seem to watch the game to enjoy it, or learn from it, or even just have something on in the background. It's all about \"the sweat\" -- anxiously watching the game, trying to will CJ McCollum to get his 4th rebound of the night or something. How could you ever learn anything about basketball in such a condition?\n",

    "Shouldn't you want to be a sharp? It's a game of skill, why wouldn't you emulate people with skills? If you wanted to get good at basketball, you should probably emulate people who are good at it, not commiserate with a bunch of other people who don't know how to do it when you lose a game."

So any team can play well in stretches even if they have a lot of injuries, but their best players remaining have have to come out at some point, otherwise they get tired and play worse (or get injured). The 76ers bench only played a combined 41 minutes in that game. All five starters played an average of 40 minutes. In essence, the 76ers ran a six man rotation. Even teams in the playoffs don't do that, because the game is so fast and athletic now. Having guys playing 44 minutes in the regular season is not sustainable.\n",

The underdog played hard with most of their best players out, then ended up losing by the exact amount that SRS predicts they would do with their average lineup.

    "\"Tanking\" is when the management of a basketball team decides to deliberately be bad in order to get better draft picks later on. The NBA salary cap is structured so that teams pretty much need to do this once a decade. Teams go all in to try to win a championship, and are left with a ton of big contracts and aging players after the window has closed. At some point they have to build for the future instead of keeping fading players.\n",

They could be pretty good next year with a couple veterans to show them the ropes. And the year after that, who knows? \n",

Not necessarily, but if they were really good and we tracked them over a whole season, the number of overs taken would look a whole lot like something like the chart above. Not a lot of all overs, or dogs, or favorites, or unders.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a longtime sofware engineer, I enjoy a good recursive data structure, but having nested points of failure like that makes me want to wretch. Same thing for putting the same bet in multiple parlays, which I've heard people do. They will have one bet they like, so they add it as a leg to a bunch of other parlays. Why have every bet you placed wiped out at once by one flukey game? \n",
    "\n",
    "Failure is always an option. Cosmic rays can actually change the data in your computer. It happens pretty often, because there are a lot of cosmic rays. To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#Effect_on_electronics): \"Studies by IBM in the 1990s suggest that computers typically experience about one cosmic-ray-induced error per 256 megabytes of RAM per month\". I don't know how often it causes a basketball player to miss a shot, but it's a possibility, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess it's fun, because the bettor feels like they're being strategic. Like it's an advanced strategy for the real parlay-knowers. But if you want to feel like a winner, why not bet in a way that minimizes your chances of feeling like a total chump?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the last parlay, notice how they took the over 20+ points for both Porzingis and Jayson Tatum. The \"only one basketball\" problem rears its head again -- they play on the same team, so if one of them scores on a possession, the other one can't. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to estimate how strong the correlation between those two events are without actually doing a bunch of math. Of course, your pals at the sportsbook are happy to do that math for you. It's a little weird to me to bet both of them to go over when the payout is only +383 for a 4 leg parlay (fair price at even odds would be +1600). Maybe the sportsbook did that math fairly, but what incentive would they have? \n",
    "\n",
    "People are picking these crazy parlays because it's a semi-creative act. It's like putting together a little story of what's going to happen in the game. \"The Celts are gonna come out wicked hawt. This one kid, Payton Pritchahd, he's gonna hit a dozen threes tonight!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just take one bet on the Celtics scoring a lot of points? Maybe do a 2 leg parlay that with an individual player you think will have a good game if you want a little extra sauce? Parlays are inherently stupid, as I've already covered. But there's a difference between a bet with -5% EV and one with -15% EV, or in the case of Same Game Parlays, an unknown EV that's probably bad. There are different degrees of stupid.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't see the whole thing, but this recursive parlay has at least 8 legs to it. Let's assume it's 8. One might think that almost winning is about twice as likely as winning all 8. Like, you'll get 'em next time, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nope. If the bets were all at even odds, a bettor will have 8 of these \"near misses\" for every single win. There are 8 ways to miss by one leg, and only one way to win all 8 legs. \"Just barely missing\" on these huge parlays is going to be happening 4x more often than you might think."

    "If you lose, it was rigged. But if it's rigged, you can't really say you won or lost due to skill. You just happened to pick the \"rigged for\" side if you won, and the \"rigged against\" side if you lost. That definitely has nothing to do with understanding the NBA, or having skill as a gambler. These people are betting in what they believe is a rigged lottery, and losing. And still not stopping. Just learning how to rationalize and externalize losing better.\n",

    "It's hard to see any joy in that. I'm willing to believe a lot of people get more entertainment out of betting than it costs them, even if they're pretty bad at it. But I don't think those people are claiming the game is rigged when their bets lose. If it wasn't fun, they wouldn't do it.\n",

I don't think many people start doing drugs or some other vice because they think it will make them rich.\n",
