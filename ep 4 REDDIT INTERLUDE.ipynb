The best NBA teams lose 25% of their games, and the worst NBA teams win 25% of their games, so even a good team losing to a bad team isn't all that surprising, in a season with 82 games."

    "To clarify the betting lingo here, \"his starters were close to early covers\" means this bettor took the over on a prop bet like Cade Cunningham over 20 points.

But Detroit was trailing by 14 points going into the 4th, and they ended up winning the game by one point on the road. That's quite impressive. Even if the coach did it to mess with people who took the over on prop bets, he still won the game by playing the bench guys who led the comeback.\n",

    "Someone who loved the NBA and didn't bet would think \"the defending champs played bad at the beginning, but then they handled their business at the end once the undermanned 76ers got tired or regressed to the mean\". The 76ers have tons of injuries right now and have to field some players that I don't think would be playing for another NBA franchise. Kyle Lowry is 39 years old and is their backup point guard. They're definitely 19-29 for a reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even scrubs in the NBA are staggeringly athletic and have spent their whole lives perfecting their craft. So any team can play well in stretches even if they have a lot of injuries, but their best players remaining have have to come out at some point, otherwise they get tired and play worse (or get injured). The 76ers bench only played a combined 41 minutes in that game. All five starters played an average of 40 minutes. In essence, the 76ers ran a six man rotation. Even teams in the playoffs don't do that, because the game is so fast and athletic now. Having guys playing 44 minutes in the regular season is not sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 76ers coach did all he could to maximize the chances of his team winning this game. Probably to his team's detriment long-term. When 5 of your top 6 players are injured, you probably shouldn't be playing the best players you have left 40+ minutes a game versus the defending champs. Maybe just take the L and have all your guys rested for the next game. \n",

Based on SRS, a measurement of average win/loss margin adjusted by strength of schedule, the Celtics are 7.9 points better than the average team, and the 76ers are 3.28 points worse than the average. So, on a neutral court, the Celtics should be 11 point favorites. Subtract 2.5 points from Boston because the game is in Philly, and that gives a line of PHI +8.5, the exact opening line. (I doubt SRS is a great way to forecast lines overall, but it might be worth looking at.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The closing line was PHI +11.5. Philly did 3.5 points better than the free market said they would do. 3.5 points is two possessions, which is pretty significant. Anyone who bet for Philly on the spread won their bet, regardless of which line they took.\n",

But a team that is an 11.5 point underdog [only wins around 12% of the time](https://www.boydsbets.com/nba-spread-to-moneyline-conversion/), meaning the fair money line would be +716. The actual Philly money line was as low as +450 at some books, which is a terrible price for such a risk! So it was a longshot bet, and overpriced. The opening Philly money line was even worse, at +285, even though the fair price of PHI +8.5 (the opening spread) should have been +381. \n",

Those are the sides that I see naive bettors usually take -- the most plentiful oranges to squeeze \"the juice\" from.\n",

    "I know I kind of beat that one to death, but I've never seen an instance so perfect. The underdog played hard with most of their best players out, then ended up losing by the exact amount that SRS predicts they would do with their average lineup. Hand it to the 76ers, for almost winning a game with a depleted roster. They outperformed expectations, even though they lost."

    "### Tanking\n",
    "\"Tanking\" is when the management of a basketball team decides to deliberately be bad in order to get better draft picks later on. The NBA salary cap is structured so that teams pretty much need to do this once a decade. Teams go all in to try to win a championship, and are left with a ton of big contracts and aging players after the window has closed. At some point they have to build for the future instead of keeping fading players.\n",

    "But I would assume players and coaches don't tank, ever. They have absolutely no reason to. Maybe they perform worse because being on a tanking team is a bummer, but they're not trying to be bad on purpose. Imagine a marginal player on a team that bad, and as an organization is trying to tank. Why wouldn't he try hard? The worse the team is, the more likely they draft someone better than him and he loses his job. Every game is a potential to make a name for themselves and find the next job in basketball.\n",
    "\n",
    "I definitely don't think Portland is trying to tank. They have more young players than have playing time, and several guys who are finally coming into their own this season. They could be pretty good next year. In my opinion, they should really be trading \"five quarters for a dollar\" -- multiple young players for a veteran who can provide some leadership and clear up roster space. Teams coming out of a tank need to learn how to be a winning team again, so they should be going for that. Developing too many guys at once is a problem. But nobody asked my basketball opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe Toronto is trying to tank, but it's awfully hard to to win in the NBA without a top notch point guard, and they're just kind of a weird team overall. sometimes bad teams are just bad, even though they're trying to be competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low info NBA bettors don't understand any of this. They think that taking the favorite against a team they've heard is tanking is a sure bet. Free money. Anyone who takes the other side must be the stupidest person on the face of the earth. Thus when they lose, rather than learn from the experience, they have to convince themselves that the league is a \"shit product\" or somehow corrupt, because you don't know who is going to win beforehand. \n",

    "### Learning to Lose\n",
    "If you lose, it was rigged. But if it's rigged, you can't really say you won or lost due to skill. You just happened to pick the \"rigged for\" side if you won, and the \"rigged against\" side if you lost. That definitely has nothing to do with understanding the NBA, or having skill as a gambler. These people are betting in what they believe is a rigged lottery, and losing. And still not stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to see any joy in that. I'm willing to believe a lot of people get more entertainment out of betting than it costs them, even if they're pretty bad at betting. But I feel certain those types of people aren't claiming the game is rigged when their bets lose. If it wasn't fun, they wouldn't do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's true of any vice, I suppose. Some people can do a little, have fun, and be fine, but other people will turn into addicts. The big difference with sports betting is that people do it with the expectation of getting money. I don't think many people start doing drugs or some other vice because they think it will make them rich. [TODO: check if I've said this before]\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll get back to the psychology in a bit, but it's time for more math. Which teams get the most money bet on them? Does that have anything to do with winning and losing against the spread?"
