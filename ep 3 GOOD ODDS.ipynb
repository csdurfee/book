    "If the lines are unbiased, then choosing your bets by flipping a coin would lead to winning 50% of the time. Losing substantially more or less than 50% is equally improbable, for a coin or a human. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an \"unlucky\" bettor who lost 60% of the time. They would actually be the greatest of all time, because you could just take the opposite side of their bets and win 60% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you assume the lines are fair, bad bettors don't go broke because they lose a lot. They go broke because they can't win often enough to beat the vig, or risk too much on each bet. They may do worse than flipping a coin, but not a lot worse. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a coin wins 50% of the time and somebody who is really into gambling also wins 50% of the time, then it's not really a game of skill. It's not a thing you can get better at by learning the lore and following the conventional wisdom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being bad at betting means still being right half the time. Being good at betting means being right 56% of the time. I'm not sure how you would tell the difference, except on large volumes of bets. Bettors who lose always seem to be able to generate a story that explains why the bet didn't win. I'll have a lot more to say about these stories. But first, some math.\n",
