    "\n",
    "But there are limits to how predictable the world is. Beating the line even 56% of the time is pretty unlikely, because humans are notoriously unreliable in both directions and there are more analytics than ever. Casual fans tend to concentrate on when a good team \"chokes\", but it seems to me just as many basketball games are decided because [a couple random guys went off](https://plaintextsports.com/nba/2025-01-15/atl-chi). Some nights it's Keaton Wallace's world, and the rest of us are just living in it. \n",

    "It can conceivably tell you when bets may be over and underpriced. How inefficient would the market have to be to allow a simple strategy like this to win 62% of the time? It's possible to convert between winning percentages and the number of points on the line with [a conversion chart](https://www.boydsbets.com/nba-spread-to-moneyline-conversion/).\n",

    "It's not really plausible to me that a person or an automated system could find an advantage of four points or more on the line. \"A couple\" points seems far more likely.\n",

    "I'm gonna let DEMAR cook for a while. My guess is that the very basic strategy will continue to be (slightly) profitable, but the more complex one will fall off.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm still looking for good historical data on betting percentages. The sportsbookreview site has older data, but it's missing for most games and includes unlikely data (such as betting percentages of 100% on one team). Sportsbooks like DraftKings [offer daily percentages](https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/draftkings-sportsbook-betting-splits/) but no historical info. But I'll keep digging.\n",
