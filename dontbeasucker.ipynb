    "## Intro\n",
    "This started because I got tired of people talking about their gambling losses online. Why talk about how you lost money doing something that you should have known would lose you money? Every season there are more ads and more talk about gambling, and it's definitely making sports worse. \n",
    "\n",
    "It contributes to this environment where the meta -- the stats, the highlights, the talking points -- are more important than the competition itself, and that's sad. Athletes shouldn't be treated like malfunctioning random number generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I was curious about how it worked. I am not a gambling expert. Before this project, my exposure to sports gambling was mainly being annoyed at the constant advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm trying to convey a little common sense and intuition about how this stuff works. There are a whole lot of thought experiments, dubious philosophical insights, and silly jokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried to avoid too much formal stuff, instead running little simulations to explain ideas. I hope it's fairly approachable, but not too much. Because gambling is all math after a couple of bets. So maybe I can help people transfer their irrational math anxiety into rational betting anxiety. Math can be your pal. The casinos can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Disclaimer\n",
    "Gambling can be addictive. Anyone can become an addict. Addiction is not a question of intelligence or virtue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you're saying, \"I don't know I'm going to lose\". True, but you're also not going to bet one time, especially if you win. What happens over the long term? Betting is about statistics, not feelings, and the sportsbooks are better at that than you are, especially in the heat of the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to try betting without the losses? Just do it on paper. What's the downside? People play board games with fake money and trade stocks with fake money and still have fun. OK, a lot of family Monopoly games end in tears, but nobody's broke in real life at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see, the bets that sportsbooks push on naive gamblers are guaranteed losers in the long run, regardless of skill. Even if you know more about sports than the average bettor, you're still probably going to lose money. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would guess maybe 1% of bettors make money long term. The estimate I see online is 3% are successful, but that seems way too high. I would guess it's more like an MLM at less than 1% success rate. It's definitely not a 50/50 split between winners and losers. I wonder if that naive assumption drives some people to bet."

    "At a high level, there has to be a way to convert between money lines and point spreads based on what real world data says. Based on real data, a -10 favorite wins ___ % of the time, which equates to a ___ money line, right? Without needing to know anything about statistics, you can assume there's a way to convert back and forth from a spread to a money line.\n",

    "Money lines probably aren't that bad of a deal, except on extreme favorites or extreme underdogs, but they do make the math harder. The vig isn't obvious on money lines, and they have different probabilities. A bunch of bets against the spread or point totals all have a roughly 50/50 shot of winning. So you can add those together and analyze them cleanly. Money lines have different odds of winning, which makes the math hard if you're trying to assess performance. [14]\n",

You could easily go 4-1 on money lines betting the heavy favorites and lose money. Or, worse yet, think that 4-1 record means you have skill. There would have to be a lot of value on money lines to justify making the math and the psychology a mess, in my opinion.\n"

    "If you look at the random walks for p=.524, you could assign stories to all of those graphs. Some of them \"got off to a hot start\", then hit a rough patch. One of them \"killed it\" from the get-go.  Pretty much all of them had long winning and losing streaks a times. If you've heard of technical analysis, do you see any technical analysis \"signals\" in these graphs? \n",
    "\n",
    "If the 9 graphs were stock prices, which one would you consider the best investment? \n",
    "\n",
    "They're equally bad investments. All have the same expected value moving forwards, which is zero, because they're winning just enough to pay the vig, but not make profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous results are meaningless and have no bearing on whether the next step will be up or down. Every step is essentially a new random walk. The coin doesn't remember what has happened in the past. We do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what's known in math as a Martingale, named after a \"betting system\" that was popular in France hundreds of years ago. The basic idea behind all these betting systems is to \"chase\" losses by betting more when you're losing.\n",

People do these chase systems on paper and end up taking million dollar bets to try to get out of a million dollar hole. \"If I keep doubling down, eventually I'll win it all back.\" Maybe if you have infinite capital and unlimited time. Otherwise the Gambler's Ruin [16] is certain. The market can stay liquid longer than you can stay irrational."

Seems like a lot to ask of one little brain.\n",

A \".79\" is probably more likely to win than a \".62\", but that's another thing to estimate.
